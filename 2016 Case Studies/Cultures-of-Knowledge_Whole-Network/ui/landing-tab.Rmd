This application provides two proof-of-concept approaches for examining a representative part of the network of the ‘intelligencer’ Samuel Hartlib (c.1600–1662) and for analyzing its composition and structure, the various relationships between its members, and the roles played by individuals and institutions. The project is the outcome of a collaboration between <a href="https://www.it.ox.ac.uk/do/research-support">Academic IT Research Support</a> and <a href="http://culturesofknowledge.org">Cultures of Knowledge</a> at the University of Oxford.

<p>
Prosopography, or collective biography, is concerned with identifying patterns of activity and connectivity in large quantities of data that may be missed using synthetic approaches. It is a potentially useful method for gaining insight into the large and sometimes complex networks that constituted the ‘Republic of Letters’, the intellectual community of 16–19th-century Europe. The prosopographical approach consists of collecting relevant quantities of biographical data of all members of a well-defined group according to pre-selected categories, which are then analyzed in different ways. The modules included in this application aim to provide a powerful and easy-to-use tool for prosopographical data visualization and analysis.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/blog/?catalogue=samuel-hartlib">network of Samuel Hartlib</a> was chosen, together with the complementary network of John Amos Comenius (1592–1670), as case studies, because they represent the intricate networks one should be able to unravel with the use of the prosopographical tool. The members of these networks were widely dispersed, highly mobile, and included some well-known figures, but many more figures about whom little is known.
</p>

<p>
The conceptual data model underlying the prosopographical tool is event-based and person-centred. It was designed to facilitate capturing the broad range of relationships and activities typical of an early modern intellectual, with a focus on contact and location history. The data were originally captured in spreadsheets, each revolving around a member of Hartlib's circle who is entered as the ‘primary participant’. The people and organizations connected to the primary participant are entered in his spreadsheet as ‘secondary participants’. To date (May 2016) the complete Hartlib dataset contains the prosopographical data of 130 people, numbering over 6,000 events in total.
</p>

<p>
For these proof of concepts a representative subset of eleven spreadsheets was selected, combining the most populated spreadsheets and spreadsheets of people who were at the centre of Hartlib’s network, and taking into account geographical distribution and varying social positions. The selection consists of:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Johann Heinrich Alting (1618–1679)</li>
<li>Heinrich Appelius (fl. 1628–1658)</li>
<li>Nicholas Arnold (1618–1680)</li>
<li>Theodor Haak (1605–1690)</li>
<li>Georg Hartlib (d. 1651)</li>
<li>Samuel Hartlib (c.1600–1662)</li>
<li>Goddofred Hotton (1596–1656)</li>
<li>Thomas Roe (1581–1644)</li>
<li>Johann Friedrich Schlezer (1610–1673)</li>
<li>Caspar Streso (1603–1664)</li>
<li>William Waller (1598–1668)</li>

</ul>

<p>
This subset numbers 423 events in total, involving 617 people and organizations. Organizations are included in the graphs to show who could have known whom, for example, because people studied at the same university at the same time.

The modules were built by Martin Hadley, data scientist in the <a href="http://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/acit-rs-team">Academic IT Research Support team</a>, using <a href=http://shiny.rstudio.com>Shiny</a>, RStudio’s interactive web application framework based on the programming language R. The visualizations were designed by the <a href="http://www.culturesofknowledge.org/">‘Cultures of Knowledge’</a> Project Director, Howard Hotson, Digital Project Manager, Arno Bosse and Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Robin Buning.

The prosopographical data shown here was captured by Robin Buning and Postdoctoral Research Fellow Iva Lelková, partly on the basis of the biographical information collected at an earlier stage by Postdoctoral Research Fellow Leigh Penman and Howard Hotson. This research was carried out as part of a pilot project for a prosopographical tool for the analysis and visualization of early modern intellectual networks. The goal was to extend the union catalogue of learned correspondence in <a href="http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/">‘Early Modern Letters Online’</a> with additional research and analytic tools so that it could fulfil the potential of the resource and meet the needs of a new generation of scholarly users and contributors.
